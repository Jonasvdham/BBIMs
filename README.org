* BBIMs

Thesis research project into the carbon-removal potential of bio-based
insulation materials (BBIMs)

* DLCA

[[file:DLCA.py]]

Notes
- make_dataset assumes positive CO2bio, DLCA assumes negative
- Where did I get the alpha values? They are different from Hoxha e.a. 2020

** Missing data

- EcoInvent: Flax, Hemp, Straw, EPS
- Biogenic CO2: Hemp

** Anomalies

#+begin_src python
df = pd.read_csv("data/Ecoinvent.tsv", sep="\t")
sum(df['kg CO2-eq']<df['kg CO2'])
#+end_src

890 / 5421 rows have higher CO2 than CO2-eq

** TODO

- Write to output file
- Generate better plots (radiative forcing, GWP)
- Decide how to handle tf of interest and time_horizon for construction (i.e.
  consider the impact until 2100 of houses constructed until 2050)

* Make Dataset

[[file:make_dataset.py]]

Notes
- CO2_bio:
  - Currently not counting biogenic CO2 in cellulose as it is recycled
  - Missing hemp
- Add KG of insulation per house depending on material
  - currently using placeholder value of 1000kg per unit
- Check if dataset is correctly read in with dots/commas
- check lifecycle stages which are included now
  - a1-a3 from Ecoinvent.tsv
  - C from carbon content (KBOB)
    - how does this work for non-biobased?
  - D: can make some assumptions

** TODO

- Add KG of insulation per house depending on material
- Fix placeholder values for rotation time - (model N(r/2, r/4) ?)
  - check if loop i in range(rotation) works for species with r=0.5
