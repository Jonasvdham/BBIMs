* BBIMs

Thesis research project into the carbon-removal potential of bio-based
insulation materials (BBIMs)

* TODOs

[[file:make_dataset.py]]

- Work out different build scenario's (linear, fast, slow)
  - Different function than sigmoid probably
- Add CO2_bio (i.e. biogenic carbon values) from KOBO

[[file:DLCA.py]]

- Make call to [[file:make_dataset.py]]
- Write to output file
- Generate better plots (radiative forcing, GWP)
