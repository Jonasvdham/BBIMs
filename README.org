* BBIMs

Thesis research project into the carbon-removal potential of bio-based
insulation materials (BBIMs)

* TODOs

[[file:make_dataset.py]]

- Add CO2_bio (i.e. biogenic carbon values) from KBOB
  - Currently not counting biogenic CO2 in cellulose as it is recycled
- Add KG of insulation per house depending on material
  - currently using placeholder value of 1000kg per unit
- Check if dataset is correctly read in with dots/commas

[[file:DLCA.py]]

- Make call to [[file:make_dataset.py]]
- Write to output file
- Generate better plots (radiative forcing, GWP)
- make_dataset assumes positive CO2bio, DLCA assumes negative
- how to handle tf of interest and time_horizon for construction (i.e. consider
  the impact until 2100 of houses constructed until 2050)
** Missing data

- EcoInvent: Flax, Hemp, Straw, EPS
- Biogenic CO2: Hemp


** Anomalies

#+begin_src python
df = pd.read_csv("data/Ecoinvent.tsv", sep="\t")
sum(df['kg CO2-eq']<df['kg CO2'])
#+end_src

890 / 5421 rows have higher CO2 than CO2-eq
